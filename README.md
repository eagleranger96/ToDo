A simple command line based todo list which can help indies and newbie programmers keep track of their todo job list. Since this project is completely open source, it can help programmers some important concepts about C language such as file handling.

## Getting Started

Currently this project is only for windows operating system and work on making it cross platform is in progress. For any version of windows OS both 32 and 64 bit systems, just download the release and start using this project.

### Prerequisites

You can simply download the executable and start using the program, it's portable for all windows platforms.

If you wish to update the code and compile a new version for your system, then you will need the following: -
* An IDE for writing the program,
* a C-language compiler. Use the old compiler such as Borland C++ (This project has been compiled using Borland C++ 5.5.
This project uses the header file "conio.h" provided by the Borland compiler. If you wish to use a newer compiler such as MinGW, then you may need to implement few functions of it yourself.


### Installing

To setup development environment to run this project, make sure your system fulfils all requirements as mentioned in the prerequisites  section. To use Borland C compiler download it from [here](https://edn.embarcadero.com/article/20633).
